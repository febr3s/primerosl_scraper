// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's
// vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.

//
// Here is the link to the full Mirador file, add full file to javascripts folder,
// change out version (3.0.0-rc.1) in naming both in js file and in require line.
// Make sure to let page fully load or you may only copy part of the js file
// and it won't work:
// https://unpkg.com/mirador@3.0.0-rc.1/dist/mirador.min.js
